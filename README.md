# Basic Integration Application on Azure
This is a guide to setting up Azure API Management (APIM) protected by Azure AD authentication (AAD Auth) with API requests being forwared to a Logic App backend. The data is then stored in a CosmosDB.

## Current state of the guide.
Documented right now are manual steps for deploying the various Azure resources to build a simple end-to-end integration application. The primary aim of this repository is to teach new developers how the various Azure resources can be connected together to build an application and to understand the solution "under the covers". 

## Roadmap
Eventually a scripted/ARM/Bicep approach will be made available so that the whole application can be deployed for demonstration purposes.
